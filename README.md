## Background
Cookie Cats is a popular mobile puzzle game where players complete a task and level up. While players completes levels, they encounter gates after completing certain number of levels. Gates force players to wait for sometime before they can playfurther or make in game purchases. 

Even though Cookie Cats overall popularity is growing over time with players subscribing to try out the game, but, revenue from in-game purchases has been declining over time and total number of active players are also declining with players uninstalling the game after playing for few days.  

## Business Objective
Increase YoY revenue from game purchases by increasing retention rate of gamers

## Analytical Objective
Test CEO's hypothesis to analyze if moving the first gate from level 30 to 40 increases retention rate and number of game rounds played.
